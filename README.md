# Malware-Analysis

## Objective

The Malware Analysis project aimed to analyze and dissect malware samples, uncovering their code structure and behavioral pattern through Static & Dynamic Analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Acquired proficiency in executing malware within a controlled environment to observe real-time behavior and assess potential impact.
- Developed skills in reverse engineering to dissect malware, unraveling its code structure, encryption, and evasion techniques.
- Gained knowledge on the analysis of malware-generated network traffic to identify communication patterns, command-and-control servers, and data exfiltration methods.

### Tools Used

- VMs : RemNux & FlareVM for controlled malware analysis.
- Virustotal : to check IP's, files, domains for maliciousness.
- PeStudio : to get info on strings inside malware files & much more
- INetSim : to spoof/simulate Networking services such DNS, HTTP, HTTPS.
- Procmon : to monitor proccesses for suspicious behaviour.
- Wireshark : to intercept & analyse malicious network traffic.
- Any.Run : Additional dynamic sandboxing.
